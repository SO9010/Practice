This is a simple program in C++ and Python that will be able to cycle 
through a vector/list of Ints and return a number that apears an odd 
number of times. Here are the instructions: 
Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an off number 
of times. 
There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of 
times. 
EXAMPLES:
[7] should return 7. as it only occurs 1 time(which is odd) 
[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, as it occurs 3 times.
